# ARediStar
Pronounced like "A Register" but D instead of G and Star instead of Ster.

A basic Flask/Redis app that produces a string.


## Installation

- Make sure you have <a href="https://docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> installed on your computer
- Clone the repo (Next section)
- run ``` docker-compose up```

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/drahamim/aredistar`

### Setup

> Change into the repo directory and run

```shell
$ cd aredistar
$ docker-compose up
```

## Features
Nothing special. It returns a pre-configured string.

## Usage 
Run the code and if you want you can use it as the base for future projects. It's super simple right now but what base isn't. 

## What I used
- Flask (Flask is a simple Python web framework.)
- Python 3 (Because while prevalent Python 2 should not be used for active dev)
- Pre-configured redis container (Why re-invent the wheel for a demo)
- Docker (because containers. Though makeing a k8s manifest would be an interesting adventure but overkill for this)


Thanks for looking. 
Feel free to contribute through PRs but nothing is formal for now.
